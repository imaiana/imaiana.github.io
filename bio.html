  <div class="who">
  My name is Imai Anabayan and I was born and raised in St. Louis. I came to Northwestern as I was drawn to its quantitative programs and the professional opportunities offered by the city of Chicago. I chose my majors, MMSS and Computer Science, to develop a broad technical skillset.

  However, during my freshman winter, as I was working with a local nonprofit to help raise funds, I became interested in finance. This led to my fascination with the for-profit side of the business world. To learn more, I got more involved on campus. Specifically, last summer I was able to work as a Research Assistant at Kellogg to help create a brand new M&A simulation course for the Executive MBA program. This was my first real exposure to investment banking, private equity, and the deal process.</div>

  Building on this, this past winter I was able to get work experience at Chicago Venture Partners, a firm focused on small investments in early-stage public companies. Afterward, I realized that I also wanted to get exposure working with slightly more mature companies and later-stage investments. This led to my decision to take on a role as a private equity summer analyst at Shore Capital Partners, a middle-market healthcare-oriented private equity firm. Going forward, I'm hoping to continue developing my financial, analytical, and client-facing abilities within the finance industry.
